## Why I Built This

I couldn’t find a study app that matched my workflow so I built one from scratch. Every feature reflects challenges I faced while studying and I hope it helps others too!  

Key frustrations I solved:

- Buttons not functioning correctly on click.  
- Timer not running in real-time and pausing issues.  
- Lack of flexibility in adding, editing, deleting and rearranging study sessions.  
- No way to skip breaks or sessions when needed.  
- Hard-to-read last minute alerts that caused stress.
